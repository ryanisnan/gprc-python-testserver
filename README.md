# Careers Matching Service - A test run #

## Goals ##
1. To stand up a quick pseudo matching service that takes a given set of inputs and returns a set of fake career recommendations. For simplification, the algorithm used to compute the recommendations will be contrived and rudimentary in its scope.
2. To communicate with a consumer via gRPC.
